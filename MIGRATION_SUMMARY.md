# Migration Summary: Tonton_suites to Tonton

This document summarizes the migration of the Tonton app from the Tonton_suites directory to the original Tonton directory.

## Migration Steps Completed

1. **Verified Functionality**: Confirmed that the Tonton app in Tonton_suites had all required functionality:
   - Supabase initialization with correct URL and API key
   - AIService implementation for image analysis
   - Supabase Edge Functions for processing images
   - Test images for validation

2. **Copied Files**: Transferred all files from Tonton_suites/Tonton to the original Tonton directory:
   - Source code files 
   - Configuration files
   - Assets and test images
   - Documentation
   - Supabase Edge Functions

3. **Updated Paths**: Modified the test_image_analysis.dart file to use the new directory paths:
   - Updated test image paths from Tonton_suites/Tonton to Tonton

4. **Verified Dependencies**: Successfully ran `flutter pub get` to ensure all dependencies were properly installed.

## Key Features Confirmed

- **Supabase Integration**: The app now uses Supabase for backend services instead of Firebase.
- **Image Analysis**: Implemented image analysis functionality using Google's Gemini AI model.
- **Test Framework**: Included a standalone test script (test_image_analysis.dart) for testing the image analysis functionality.
- **Test Images**: Provided sample test images with different characteristics to validate the AI analysis.

## How to Run

1. Run the main app:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/hiroshikodera/repos/_active/apps/Tonton
   flutter run
   ```

2. Test the image analysis functionality:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/hiroshikodera/repos/_active/apps/Tonton
   flutter run -t test_image_analysis.dart
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the app to ensure all features work as expected in the new location.
2. **Supabase Edge Functions**: Verify that the Edge Functions are properly deployed in your Supabase project.
3. **Cleanup**: If everything works correctly, you can safely remove the Tonton_suites directory.

## Documentation

Additional documentation files:
- `IMAGE_ANALYSIS_TESTING.md`: Detailed guide for testing the image analysis functionality.
- `test_images/README.md`: Information about the test images and how to use them.
- `CLAUDE.md`: General information about the project structure and development commands.

The migration has been completed successfully, and the Tonton app is now ready to be used from its original directory.
