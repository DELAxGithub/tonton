# Issue #9: Missing Meal Logging Widgets and State

## Overview
References within the codebase mention `lib/widgets/meal_logging/*` and
`lib/state/meal_logging_state.dart`, but these paths do not exist in the current
repository. The AI meal logging flow screens rely on these components for
state management and UI widgets.

## Tasks
- Investigate older branches or commits for the missing files.
- Recreate the `meal_logging_state` provider/state class and related widgets if
they cannot be recovered.
- Update routing and screen implementations once these components are
available.
