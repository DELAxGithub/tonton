# Issue #5 Handoff Notes

## Implementation Summary

The AI nutrition estimation feature has been successfully implemented using Supabase Edge Functions and OpenAI's GPT-4o model. The feature allows users to enter meal descriptions and receive estimated calorie and macronutrient information.

## Key Components

1. **Supabase Integration**:
   - Edge Function `estimate-nutrition` deployed to Supabase
   - OpenAI API key securely stored as a Supabase secret
   - Flutter app configured to communicate with Supabase

2. **Data Models**:
   - `EstimatedMealNutrition` for storing complete nutrition estimates
   - `NutrientInfo` for storing macronutrient (PFC) values

3. **Services & Providers**:
   - `AIService` for communication with Supabase
   - `aiEstimationProvider` for state management

4. **UI Integration**:
   - Meal input screen enhanced with AI estimation capability
   - Loading states and error handling implemented

## Points to Address in Future Issues

### API Key and Environment Management

- Currently using API PoC's Supabase project credentials
- For production release, create a dedicated Supabase project
- Implement environment switching (dev/staging/prod)
- Establish API key rotation policy

### Prompt Engineering

- Current prompt works well but could be improved with:
  - More specific instructions for diverse meal descriptions
  - Additional validation parameters for realistic nutrition values
  - Support for more complex meals or recipes

### Error Handling Enhancements

- Implement more detailed error classification:
  - OpenAI rate limit errors
  - Content filter blocks
  - Network connectivity issues
  - Malformed responses
- Provide more user-friendly error messages

### PFC Balance Features

- Consider adding visualization for macronutrient balance
- Implement goal setting for daily/weekly PFC ratios
- Add tracking and reporting on PFC trends

### Performance Optimization

- Cache common meal estimates to reduce API calls
- Optimize loading states and transitions
- Implement graceful degradation when service unavailable

## Supabase Implementation Verification

Before proceeding to subsequent issues, verify:

1. The Edge Function is properly deployed and accessible
2. API key is securely stored and not exposed in client code
3. Error handling properly catches and reports all error types
4. The implementation works across different network conditions
