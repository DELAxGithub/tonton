# Image Analysis Production Readiness Checklist

## Configuration

- [ ] Supabase project URL and anon key are set for production (SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)
- [ ] Edge Function `process-image-gemini` is deployed to production Supabase project
- [ ] GEMINI_API_KEY is set in production Supabase secrets
- [x] Image size limits are configured appropriately (currently 10MB max in AIService)
- [x] Image compression parameters configured in ImagePicker (maxWidth: 1800, maxHeight: 1800, quality: 88)
- [x] MIME type detection implemented with mime package

## Testing

- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass using `flutter test test/image_analysis_integration_test.dart`
- [ ] Edge Function standalone tests pass with `dart run tools/test_edge_function.dart`
- [ ] Standalone test app runs successfully with `flutter run -t tools/standalone_image_analysis_app.dart`
- [ ] Image processing tests run successfully with `dart run tools/test_image_processing.dart`
- [x] Error handling is implemented in AIService and AIEstimationProvider
- [x] Loading and error states are handled in UI (LinearProgressIndicator and error messages)
- [ ] Different image types (JPEG, PNG) have been tested
- [ ] Various foods have been tested for recognition accuracy
- [ ] Edge cases (blurry images, non-food images) have been tested

## Performance

- [x] Image compression is optimized using ImagePicker with maxWidth/maxHeight/quality (1800px max, 88% quality)
- [ ] Response times are acceptable (typically under 5 seconds)
- [x] UI remains responsive during image processing (using async operations)
- [x] Loading indicators display during processing
- [ ] Error rates are monitored
- [x] Edge Function has proper error handling in place

## User Experience

- [x] Loading indicators display correctly during processing with LinearProgressIndicator
- [x] Error messages are user-friendly in the UI
- [x] Results display is clear with fields auto-filled
- [x] Users can edit AI-provided values after analysis
- [x] Instructions provided in the help box under nutrition fields
- [x] Users can clear selected images with "Clear Image" button

## Security

- [x] Gemini API key is stored in Supabase secrets, not client-side
- [x] Base64 encoding used for image transmission
- [x] Image data is processed but not stored without explicit consent
- [x] Image size limit of 10MB enforced to prevent excessive resource usage
- [ ] Rate limiting is configured for Edge Function
- [ ] Authentication is properly configured for the Edge Function

## Documentation

- [x] User guide is complete (see `docs/ai_image_analysis_guide.md`)
- [x] Developer documentation is up-to-date (see `docs/IMAGE_ANALYSIS_INTEGRATION.md` and `docs/IMAGE_ANALYSIS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
- [x] Edge Function parameters and responses are documented
- [x] Edge Function code is well-commented
- [x] Configuration requirements are documented
- [x] Testing tools created for debugging and verification
- [x] Troubleshooting guidance is provided in docs

## Maintenance Plan

- [ ] Monitoring is in place for Edge Function usage and errors
- [x] Testing tools are created for ongoing verification
- [x] Structured logging is implemented in AIService and Edge Function
- [ ] Regular testing schedule is established
- [ ] Update process is documented for potential Gemini API changes
- [ ] Fallback mechanism to text-based analysis exists if image analysis is unavailable
- [ ] Performance metrics are tracked and reviewed regularly

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement more robust JSON parsing for non-standard Gemini responses
- [ ] Add support for analyzing multiple food items in a single image
- [ ] Improve accuracy with more specific prompts or fine-tuning
- [ ] Add image rotation and cropping tools for better user control
- [ ] Add optional image storage for tracking meals over time
- [ ] Implement offline image queuing for analysis when connectivity is restored
- [ ] Add feedback mechanism for improving AI accuracy over time
- [ ] Implement caching for faster repeated analyses and reduced API costs
