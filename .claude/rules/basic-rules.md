# Basic Rules

1. **Always TDD (Test-Driven Development)**
   - No code without a failing test first.
   - Follow the Red-Green-Refactor cycle.

2. **Ask When Unsure**
   - Do not assume requirements. If something is ambiguous, ask the user.

3. **Conventional Commits**
   - Use standard commit prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
